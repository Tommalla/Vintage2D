# Vintage2D

This is a driver for a simple 2D graphics card.

The qemu patch for qemu-2.5.1 that emulates the device is in docs/. The official spec of the device (in Polish) can be found [here](http://students.mimuw.edu.pl/ZSO/PUBLIC-SO/2015-2016/_build/html/z2_driver/vintage2d.html#z2-vintage2d)
and the task (in Polish as well) can be found [here](http://students.mimuw.edu.pl/ZSO/PUBLIC-SO/2015-2016/_build/html/z2_driver/index.html).
